## About the project
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

To address this issue, AtliQ's revenue management team hired a third-party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data. The team analyzed the AtliQ hospitality dataset and found the following key metrics:

-> ADR (average daily rate)

-> Realization% (successful "check out" %)

-> RevPAR (revenue per available room)

-> DBRN (daily booked room nights)

-> DSRN (daily sellable room nights)

-> DURN (daily utilized room nights)

The team also generated a dashboard to provide insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain, which revealed the following key findings:

-> The luxury category produces more revenue than the business category.

-> Mumbai generates the highest revenue among all cities.

-> Delhi has a higher occupancy rate and average rating compared to other cities.

-> Occupancy rates are higher on weekends, particularly on Sundays and Saturdays.

-> Make My Trip is the most popular booking platform for AtliQ hotels.

-> There is a fall in monthly revenue during June.

-> The total revenue and occupancy rate of AtliQ hotels are 1.71 billion and 57.8%, respectively.

-> The average monthly revenue and occupancy rate are 0.6 billion and 58%.

-> Weekday rates and weekend rates seem to be the same.

-> Revenue can be increased by fluctuating prices according to season, weekdays, and weekends.

Based on these insights, AtliQ's revenue management team can make data-driven decisions 
to optimize revenue and occupancy rates. They can focus on promoting luxury hotels, 
particularly in Mumbai, and target Make My Trip users for booking. They can also consider 
adjusting prices to attract more guests during low occupancy periods, such as weekdays and the month of June.
